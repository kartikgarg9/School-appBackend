CHAPTER 1

Colin Lamb's Narrative

To use police terms: at 2.59 p.m. on September 9th, I was
proceeding along Wilbraham Crescent in a westerly direc-
tion. It was my first introduction to Wilbraham Crescent,
and frankly Wilbraham Crescent had me baffled.

I had been following a hunch with a persistence becoming
more dogged day by day as the hunch seemed less and less
likely to pay off. I'm like that.

The number I wanted was 61, and could I find it? No, I
could not. Having studiously followed the numbers from 1
to 35, Wilbraham Crescent then appeared to end. A thor-
oughfare uncompromisingly labelled Albany Road barred
my way. I turned back. On the north side there were no
houses, only a wall. Behind the wall, blocks of modern flats
soared upwards, the entrance of them being obviously in
another road. No help there.

I looked up at the numbers I was passing. 24, 23, 22,
21. Diana Lodge (presumably 20, with an orange cat on
the gate post washing its face), 19-

The door of 19 opened and a girl came out of it and
down the path with what seemed to be the speed of a bomb.
